    How the information are collected

    The information of the fallens and detainees on this website are collected in (3) ways:
    1) By monitoring the news updates on social media (Facebook, Twitter) that came out from credible sources;
    2) By collecting information on our platform that are already verified by families and friends of fallens and detainees by directly sharing with us through “Inform Us”
    3) By making reference to the reports of media channels and associations

    How the information are of use

    1) The information of the fallens and detainees can be viewed altogether in one place;
    2) With accurate information, we can constantly speak out for detainees until they are released, and the information shared on the website would be helpfully available to anyone who seeks to help out the detainees while they are kept in custody or going on trials.
    3) As the website is available in both English and Myanmar version, international media, journalists and rapporteurs to Myanmar can obtain the latest information in one place;
    4) In the future, the collected information on the webiste will be helpful for CRPH in erasing the police records of unlawfully detained people
